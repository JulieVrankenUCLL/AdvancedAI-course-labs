    "Ada Turing Travelogue, or as everyone calls her, Ada just started working part time at her parents travel agency. She has a keen understanding and interest of everything related to applied computer science ranging from server & system management to full stack software development. Through database foundations she already understands how to query data and programming 1 and 2 covered the essentials about the Python programming language. Recently she has just decided to start learning about data analytics & machine learning as well.\n",
